## Volumes Yaml

Sometimes, we want to use volumes as we create kubernetes services, but we don't the details. Like, we want to use rbd pv, but don't know the parametes, and what is then means.

Volumes Yaml is just for this problem. We expect to collect all kinds volume, pv, pvc, storageclass yaml model, and also to provide useful examples;


## Storage Current

    RBD
    NFS
    GlusterFs
    CephFs
    Minio
